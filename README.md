In this folder contains various projects that I have done over the course of my university life.

NYC Data is where I visualise various datasets such as prices and other factors that I think may affect prices and forecast NYC House Prices data with OLS and ARIMA.

Sephora Scraping & RShiny is where I scrape product data from Sephora using Selenium and perform text analysis. I then made an interactive app with RShiny to show the sentiment score for each product to help see which products has the best sentiments for each type of product category (Moisturiser, Cleanser, etc)
